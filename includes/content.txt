project1_details=This project is a simple chatbot built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The chatbot is designed to interact with users in a conversational manner. It features a text area that displays the conversation and an input field where users can type their messages. The bot provides responses based on predefined input patterns, such as greetings and common questions. The chatbot aims to offer a friendly, interactive experience and can handle basic inquiries like greetings, introductions, and responses to specific questions. This project showcases basic GUI elements and event handling in Java, along with the creation of a simple, rule-based AI chatbot.
